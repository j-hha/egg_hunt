        <p>Fiona Fox is hungry. She'd love some eggs for dinner and she just knows where to find them: at farmer Firmus' hen house. Too bad that the farmer is a very light sleeper and has an endless supply of boots to throw at egg thieves ... Can you help Fiona get to the eggs? Hide her in the bushes before the farmer wakes up and the little fox might not have to go home hungry.</p>

            <dt>How do I start the game?</dt>
            <dd>Just hit the red start button on the right.</dd>
            <dt>How do I move the fox?</dt>
            <dd>Press the <strong>&#x2192;</strong> key.</dd>
            <dt>How do hide Fiona?</dt>
            <dd>Move Fiona to the nearest bush. If her fur gets darker, she is hidden and the farmer won't be able to aim at her.</dd>
            <dt>How do I know if Fiona has been hit?</dt>
            <dd>Fiona will tell you when she decides to retreat. She'll lose a health point and you will see one heart disappear from the status bar in the top left corner.</dd>
            <dt>How do I know if Fiona has gotten to the eggs?</dt>
            <dd>Fiona will tell you, once she's managed to get to the hen house. One of the eggs will disappear from the status bar in the top right corner.</dd>
            <dt>How often can I try?</dt>
            <dd>This game is made up of rounds. Each time Fiona steals an egg or the farmer hits her with his boot, the round ends and Fiona will try again the next 'night'. However, if Fiona has lost all of her health points, she'll stop trying to get to the hen house. She won't return either if there are no more eggs left in the barn.</dd>
            <dt>Can I play this game with a friend?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, just head over to the options tab. The person playing the fox can move her with the <strong>&#x2192;</strong> key. The person playing the farmer can hit
            the <strong>A</strong> key to attack. Note: you will have to think strategically about when to throw the boot. Once you've attacked, the farmer will go back to rest for a short while. You will have to wait before you can wake him up again.</dd>
            <dt>Can I play this on a handheld device?</dt>
            <dd>No, not yet. Sorry!</dd>
